let x = 5;  // variable x is assigned the value 5
// x = 10;     // variable x is reassigned the value 10
console.log(x);


// In JavaScript, let and const are used to declare variables,
//  but they have different behaviors and use cases.






// const y = 5;  // variable y is assigned the value 5
// y = 10;       // This will throw an error - y cannot be reassigned
// console.log(y);


// Here, the const keyword is used to declare the variable y, which
// is assigned the value 5. Later on, when we try to reassign y to a
//  new value, we get an error because y cannot be reassigned.
// In summary, let is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned a
// new value, while const is used to declare a variable that cannot be
//  reassigned a new value once it has been initialized. You should use 
// let when you need to reassign a variable, 
// and use const when you know the variable value will not change.
