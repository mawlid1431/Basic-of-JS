// n JavaScript, there are several built-in data types that you can 
// use to store and manipulate values:
// Number: Used for numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
// String: Used for textual data, such as names or messages.
// Boolean: Used for logical values, either true or false.
// Undefined: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
// Null: Represents a deliberate non-value.
// Object: Used for complex data structures that can hold multiple values.
// Symbol: A new data type introduced in ECMAScript 6, used to create unique
//  identifiers.
// It's worth noting that JavaScript also has a special data type called NaN, 
// which stands for "Not a Number". This is a value that represents an undefined or unrepresentable mathematical value,
// and is typically the result of an arithmetic operation that cannot be performed.
// In addition to these built-in data types, JavaScript also has several composite or derived data types,
// including arrays, functions, and regular expressions, which are built on
//  top of the basic data types.


//  let hungry= false
//  let age=23
//  let name =" my name is malit"
//  console.log(typeof hungry);
//  console.log(typeof age);
//  console.log(typeof name);


// let name ='khader'
// console.log("name");
// console.log(name);
