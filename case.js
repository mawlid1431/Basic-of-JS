// case sensitive  means that js allow to start  when you are naming varibale must start with { $,_,letter, smal or capital }
// examples
let name = "mustafa";
console.log(name);
let _name = "khaalid";
console.log(_name);
let $name = " malitfx";
console.log($name);
let Name = "anoga aya wayn";
console.log(Name);

//   All of the variable names in your example code are different because JavaScript is
// case-sensitive and allows a wide range of characters in variable names. Let's take a closer
//  look at each variable name:
// name - This variable name is in all lowercase letters and is a valid variable name in
//  JavaScript. It stores the string value "mustafa".
// _name - This variable name begins with an underscore character, which is allowed in
// JavaScript variable names. It stores the string value "khaalid".
//  $name - This variable name begins with a dollar sign, which is also allowed in JavaScript
// variable names. It stores the string value "malitfx".
// Name - This variable name is different from the previous ones because it starts with an
//  uppercase letter. In JavaScript, variable names are case-sensitive, so Name is considered a
//  different variable from name.
// It stores the string value "anoga aya wayn".
// In summary, variable names in JavaScript can contain letters, numbers, underscores,
// and dollar signs. However, they cannot begin with a number, and they are case-sensitive,
// meaning that name, Name, and NAME are all different variable names.
